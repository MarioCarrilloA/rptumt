# Software & utils to monitor 3D stem cell culture

This project consists of a software application and utilities needed to complement
the thesis topic **Investigation of machine learning methods to monitor 3D stem cell culture
in a bioreactor** and it is just a prototype to illustrate how the trained models work.

It ONLY supports:
